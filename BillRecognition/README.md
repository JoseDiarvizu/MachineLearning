# Bills Recognition
This is a Python model made with Opencv that helps you recognize MXN bills from the following denominations: 20, 50, 200, 500. You can download the video to test it, or you can uncomment the code on line 418 to use your webcam.

To train this model download the following .zip file that contains severel pictures of bills with different denomination.
Once you downloaded it, extract it in the same directory of all the other files.

THIS MODEL IS ONLY TRAINED BASED ON COLOR. So yeah, you can simply fool the algorithm by putting an object with similar color and it'll recognize it as a bill.
